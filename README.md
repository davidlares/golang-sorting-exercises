## Sorting Exercises

Sorting algorithm exercises with GoLang. These exercises can be easily replicated in other programming languages.

## Big O Notation

This is a rather complicated and purely mathematically oriented term, but in a nutshell, it's used in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

Its advantages are:

- It describes the time in terms of how the input grows (size of the structure or elements to be processed).
- It eliminates most of the non-important computational issues.

Although it's difficult to define the time an algorithm takes it depends on the hardware.

## Sorting Algorithms

- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

Each has specifics in its execution. Quite complex to explain in detail.

## Use 

go run [filename.go]
